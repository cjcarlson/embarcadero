\usage{
varimp.diag(x.data, y.data, ri.data = NULL, iter = 50, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.data}{A data frame of covariates}

\item{y.data}{A vector of outcomes (1/0)}

\item{iter}{How many BART models to run for each of (10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200) tree models}
}
\description{
When BART is run with a small number of trees it tends to up-select variables that contribute the most meaningfully, and under-selects variables that have no relevance or contribute only marginally. As the number of trees, this pattern becomes less visible, as it overfits to less useful variables. Plotting this is a useful way of identifying which variables should be dropped - those that have the most visible increase relative to number of trees are performing the poorest.
